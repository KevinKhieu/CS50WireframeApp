Use this if you want a quick jumpstart on creating a website from scratch.

This website uses MongoDB (via Mongoose), Express, Angular.JS, and Node.JS (for back end)
Note: You will need to install MongoDB and Node to run this application. CS142 has good instructions on how to do this at http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs142/install.html

To run, navigate into this directory and:
1. in Terminal, run "mongod"
2. Open another Terminal window, navigate to this directory, and run "node webServer.js" - this starts the server at port 3000
3. Open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000, which is port 3000
